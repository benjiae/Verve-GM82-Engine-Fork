Original README:
# Verve GM8.2 Engine
A light but robust GM8.2 framework for developing IWBTG fangames.
Currently mostly finished - feature complete, but an engine has a lot of opportunities to break.
For engine instructions and documentation, look either in the sample rooms, at code comments, or in the documentation folder.
